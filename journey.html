                    I began my professional journey working in a call center while studying Business Administration.
                    My role was to monitor calls and correspondence to ensure quality and customer satisfaction.
                    Balancing full-time work and full-time study taught me discipline, time management, and what
                    customer experience looks like at the front line.

                    In 2012, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration while still working full-time.
                    Soon after graduation, I took a major step in my career by joining Ayala Land, one of the most
                    respected and prestigious real estate developers in the Philippines.

                    My first major assignment at Ayala Land was helping introduce FamilyMart convenience stores and
                    supporting the opening of more than 100 locations across the country. It was my initiation into site
                    development, partner coordination, and the pace of retail expansion.

                    of over USD 200M. Working on an island development broadened my view from individual sites to an entire
                    destination – infrastructure, tourism, environmental impact, and long-term planning.
